### Rundown of deploy process

## What was wrong

We were running the following command in heroku post-build script
`"concurrently \"npm start\" \"cd client && npm install && npm install --only=dev --no-shrinkwrap && npm start\""`
There are two things that are wrong with this:
- `npm start` starts infinite process for webpack-dev-server
- webpack dev-server is only meant to be used in development mode

## What's happening now

When deploying to production, we need to tell our app to use production version of webpack's output (bundled and minified .js and .css files) \

There are a few steps involved in this:
1. We must run `npm run build` in the /client. This will create the production build files under /client/build
2. In order to serve the production build files, they need to be in /public. Node will automatically serve all files under /public

When running production version of our app, we are only allowed to use the HTML file generated through build, our regular html file we use in dev will not work, \
since it's missing the link to bundled JS and CSS files (because create-react-app apps are not meant to be used in production) \
With that said, when app is being deployed, we're copying all files generated in /build into our public folder and replacing all dev vesions of those files \
This is not a good solution, but it works for the purpose of this project. In the real world scenario, this whole process will be handled by CI \


## Issue with DB

There were quite a few issues with Postgres connection, SSL field was configured through config vars and wasn't properly set \
